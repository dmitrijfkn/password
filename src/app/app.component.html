  <h2>Task:</h2>
  <p>Create applications to test password strength.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The essence of the assignment:</li>
    <li>Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;</li>
    <li>Changes in password strength must take place in real time;</li>
    <li>How to calculate the strength of a password:
      <ul>
        <li>Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;</li>
        <li>Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;</li>
        <li>Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the field is empty, all sections are gray;</li>
    <li>If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;</li>
    <li>If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;</li>
    <li>If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;</li>
    <li>If the password is strong, all sections are green;</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Chars considered as symbols:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>!&#64;#$%^&*()_+</li>
  </ul>
